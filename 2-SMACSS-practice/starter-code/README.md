##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I referred to both the task instruction hints and the SMACSS.com literature on base, layout and module stylings

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, I did not. Began investigation refactoring but did not feel I had a firm grasp on the idea
